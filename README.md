AYG Are you going? was developed to display events chronologically in a simple format so users can find what's going on without having to search through mulitple pages. Each user has their own specific data that they can view as well as a limited amount of data on other user's profiles. Users can create their own event, edit and delete it. They can also add other user's events to curate their own event schedule.

What sets AYG apart from other events apps is it's Watch feature which allows users to tag other users with cool, avoid and a default neutral setting. When any of those buttons are clicked the active user will be notified through a designated color on the landing page as well as their own profile if those users will be attending that event. This keeps them from having to search guest lists for their friends or people they don't enjoy. There is no interaction between users or knowledge of the tags. The app is intended for people to socialize in person and does not incentivize building followers or likes.
