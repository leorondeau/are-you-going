# are-you-going-going

Initial idea, will revise after one on one.

Features:

• User created account
• Events can be created, read, updated and deleted by each user
• Each event object will have a Yes option that increments and the option to see users attending
• Each user profile lists their name and events that that person is attending
• Searchable users

• User can add other users to a private "quit list" where they can be alerted if certain people they want to avoid are attending
• Users will be able to add people to their "scene" and have different alerts if multiple people in their group are attending
• Multiple event categories, currently it will just be an "All"
